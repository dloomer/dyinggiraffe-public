-- incremement team's post count by one in corresponding hour, day, month, year, and alltime timespans of TeamChatMessageStats (create if needed)

============================
-- Find latest hour timespan for each video, picture, caption, title in YouTubeVideoStats etc. in previous PageSettings record but not in new one
-- If exists with no end time, fill in duration if it's not the current hour and duration isn't filled in.  Duration will be 1 hour if there is no start time, otherwise less than one hour
-- If duration is newly filled in, add to duration of corresponding day, month, year, and alltime timespans.
-- Create hour timespans for all hours after last existing one, including the current hour.  Duration is 60 unless current hour (in which case it's calculated, and end time is filled in), add to duration of corresponding day, month, year, and alltime timespans
-- Find latest hour timespan for each video, picture, caption, title in YouTubeVideoStats etc. in current PageSettings record
-- If none exists, start time=now
-- If exists, but has end time, start time=now
-- If exists with no end time, fill in duration if it's not the current hour and duration isn't filled in.  Duration will be 1 hour if there is no start time, otherwise less than one hour
-- If duration is newly filled in, add to duration of corresponding day, month, year, and alltime timespans.
-- Create hour timespans for all hours after last existing one, not including the current hour.  Duration is 60, add to duration of corresponding day, month, year, and alltime timespans
